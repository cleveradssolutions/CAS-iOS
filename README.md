## Getting Started
To get started, here is the link to [iOS SDK integration documentation](https://github.com/cleveradssolutions/CAS-iOS/wiki).  

## Demo application
Each iOS example app on this repository includes a Podfile and a **Podfile.lock**. The Podfile.lock tracks the version of each Pod specified in the Podfile that was used to build the release of the iOS example apps. 

1. Run `pod install` in the same directory as the Podfile.
2. [Optional] Run `pod update` to get the latest version of the SDK.
3. Open the `.xcworkspace` file with Xcode and run the app.

See the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org) for more information on installing and updating pods.
